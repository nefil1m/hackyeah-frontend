                  <h1>Why The Effort?</h1>
                  <p>Butts left in grass and soil can harm nearby plant growth, according to a new study. The study driven by Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, England found that a cigarette butt can chop down the germination, or advancement, of plants, adding to worries about disposed of cigarette leftovers as an under-recognized, yet far reaching, pollutant.Cigarette butts cut down the germination accomplishment of grass by 10% and clover by 27%, and the shoot length by 13% and 28%, separately, as indicated by the investigation, which was distributed in the diary Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety. Weight of cigarettes littered annually up to 800 000 t ( UNEP)  which makes 84% of all cigarettes produced  internationally and 4,7 trillion butts are littered per year - 150 000 butts are littered per second biggest problem is the filters, most of which are made of cellulose acetate, a kind of plastic. That means the filters don’t readily biodegrade, although they do break down — and send thousands of tiny plastic fibers into the environment, waterways and wildlife. Along with the fibers come chemicals like arsenic, benzene and lead. In 10 years there may be more cigarette butts in the ocean than fish Cigarette.

                  <h1>How Can I Help?</h1>
                  <p>Our application will connect you to cigarette filter collection points that will eventually send what they have to recycling service companies like MéGO! (France), turning the filters into industrial-grade raw materials. In Vancouver, where people litter a million cigarette butts a day, was the first city to pioneer this partnership with such a company -  TerraCycle - , installing 110 cigarette butt recycling bins in its downtown area in 2013.
